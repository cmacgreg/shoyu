Synopsis:

Shoyu 2.0.3.2 is a modified version of the RSS Subscription Extension (by Google) version 2.0.3/r37537.

Features:

* Modified preview behavior for raw feeds and empty feeds
* Improved feed descriptions and display of content elements in Atom feeds.
* Stylesheet compatible with the Sage RSS Extension for Mozilla Firefox.
* Option to disable/hide online subscriptions.

TODO:

* Easy custom style sheet browser
	* file:// paths won't work for style sheets in extensions, no way to add to the ext's resources, http:// path is inconvenient

* Remove iframe stuff? or embrace it.

* Other Sage options? Chronological/Exhaustive, 12/24 Hour clock, allow/disallow HTML

BUGS:

* Discovered feed popup visited link is for the feed itself, not subscribe?etc
* Timestamp is a bit ugly.
